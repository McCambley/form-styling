# Form Styling
## Taking forms a step beyond with styled checkboxes and animated placeholders

In this project I've create a simple form with 5 input sections: Name, Surname, Comment, and two checkboxes reading "Make Public" and "Keep Anonymous".

I think we can all agree that forms are scary. To make them even more scary I've added the following functionality: Focus and hover effects on all inputs, animations on the placeholder text, and customization of the checkboxes, because why not?

In all seriousness, styling makes for a more streamlined and accessible user experience. The goal with this project is to practice simplifying the web for users using intellegent design.

### Enjoy!
